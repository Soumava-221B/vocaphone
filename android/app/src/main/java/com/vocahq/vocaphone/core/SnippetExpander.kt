/**
 * Expands snippet triggers into their literal expansion text.
 *
 * Matching runs after writing style: capitalization cannot rewrite a snippet's
 * literal expansion (an email trigger must not come out "Me@example.com"), and
 * case-insensitive matching still finds a capitalized trigger. When digit
 * conversion is on, [DictatedTranscript] protects a matched expansion while it
 * converts the surrounding text, then restores the literal expansion last.
 *
 * One combined regex over every trigger rather than a snippet-by-snippet
 * loop, so an expansion that happens to contain another trigger is never
 * re-expanded. Matches are applied in reverse order so an earlier match's
 * range stays valid while a later one is replaced.
